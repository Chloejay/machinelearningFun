<p>this repo will consist of the machine learning book(around 10 chapters, two chapters are still work on progress) I drafted on 2018 September when I self-taught data science related material in 2018, to transform the frontend web dev skills into data insights, including linear algebra, machine learning theory and basic supervised learning models</p>
