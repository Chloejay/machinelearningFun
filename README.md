# machinelearningisFun
<p>this repo will consist of the machine learning book(around 8 chapters, two chapters are still work on progress) I drafted on 2018 September when I self-taught data science related material in the beginning of 2018, to transform the frontend web dev skills into DS, including linear algebra, machine learning theory and basic supervised learning models</p> 

update since I have been working as junior data scientist for the DL in the computer vision field, so I will update one chapter in DL field about images.
