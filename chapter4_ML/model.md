the concept of machine learning: Machine learning is the intersection between theoretically sound computer science
and practically noisy data. Essentially, itâ€™s about machines making sense out of data in much the same way that humans do. 
to extract the pattern from data, three types learning below, one is supervised learning, fitting the data to a function, second unsupervised learning, figure out what the data is without any feedback, third is the reinforcement learning, to maximize rewards over the time.

    <li>KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors), the distance-based approximation</li>
    <li>Kmeans </li>
    <li>Decison Tree => Random Forest </li>
    <li>Linear Regression</li>
    <li>Logistic Regression </li>
