<h4>OOP</h4>
<p>why I include this chapter on the Python related data science self reading book, for Python is about light code and I learnt Javascript before Python, so much time I do compare the functionality between those two, I first knew inheritance concept is 2017 when I was learning React.js. In OOP concept, eveything is object, who should be treated as the first-class citizen in the progrmming world. On this chapter I will summarize what I learnt with code example, including main concepts composition, inheritance, polymorphism, class, generator, iterator (list/dict comprehension),built-in functions and ticks, recursion, decorator, regexp usage in NLP, exceptions and Modules</p> 

<i>[My thoughts in general] For the coding or programming is about creative thinking and the best learning is connecting to what you already learnt, so make the code writing like you are writing a story, how the story sounds like is up to the author you. Never be boring is what I liked, for I like the signer David Bowie</i>
